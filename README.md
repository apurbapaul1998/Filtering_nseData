# automated_technicalAnalysis

Technical Analysis is a great skill to have to analyse literally anything, it can be used on any asset class.
but in order to get proper/desired results we need to use technical analysis very rigorously and thoroughly, this can be a pain
specially for someone who is like me always involved in different things, doing multiple things it can be a serious pain to analyse properly
Have been researching to automate these things by using my technical skills as well as my knowledge in the stock market
It will be really great to build bots/software which can automate or atleast simplify my investing/trading journey so that I can utilise my time in some other things 
or I can learn different things
upon researching found Python/Pandas can be a help for these kind of things

in these just used three parameters which can atleast minimise my work(5%)  while searching for stocks!
