# Automated Technical Analysis Tool

This repository contains an **automated technical analysis tool** developed using **Python**. The tool simplifies the process of analyzing stocks by automating certain technical analysis tasks, making it easier to identify potential trading opportunities. By leveraging **Python** and **Pandas**, this tool minimizes the manual work involved in stock analysis.

## Project Overview

**Technical analysis** is a crucial skill for evaluating any asset class, from stocks to commodities. However, performing in-depth technical analysis manually can be time-consuming, especially for those juggling multiple responsibilities. To address this, I developed an automated tool that performs basic stock analysis using three key parameters. Although this tool currently minimizes only around **5%** of the work, it offers a starting point for automating stock analysis and helps streamline the investing/trading process.

### Key Features
- **Automates Stock Analysis**: The tool automatically performs technical analysis using three essential parameters, simplifying the task of scanning for potential trading opportunities.
- **Built with Python & Pandas**: Python, combined with the powerful **Pandas** library, provides the data manipulation and automation capabilities to perform technical analysis efficiently.
- **Reduces Manual Effort**: While the tool currently reduces only 5% of the overall effort involved in stock analysis, it significantly streamlines the early stages of finding stocks to research further.

### Parameters Used
The tool uses three specific technical analysis parameters to filter stocks. These parameters were chosen to minimize the time and effort spent manually searching for stocks while maintaining a robust analysis process.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Used as the primary programming language to automate technical analysis.
- **Pandas**: A powerful data analysis library used for managing stock data and calculations.
